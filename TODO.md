# Bulbs TODO's

## Deploy/configuration

 * Chef virtualenv creation
 * easy way to run tests in/outside of vagrant (vagrant subcommand? travis?)

## Core content

 * Better name for "Content"?
 * sync_es needs to add a mapping
 * implement Content.objects.search (keep it .filter? but is that too implicit?)
 * Unit tests for filtering/searching
 * How will tags map to sections?
 * How much workflow goes into the core product? Do we really need modified and created?
 * Base detail/list views (or mixins)

## Video

 * Bleeding-edge video.js
 * Port VAST/Preroll/responsive/sharetools plugins
 *
